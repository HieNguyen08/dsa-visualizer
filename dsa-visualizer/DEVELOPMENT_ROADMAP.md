## üí° IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION SUGGESTIONS

### 1. Start with High-Impact, Low-Effort Features:

**Week 1-2 Focus:**
- Implement **Radix Sort** (visual appeal + educational value)
- Add **Split-screen comparison** for existing sorts
- Create **Custom input generator** with patterns
- Enhance **mobile responsiveness**

**Quick Code Structure:**
```typescript
// New file: radix-sort-visualizer.tsx
// Reuse existing sorting infrastructure
// Add digit-by-digit animation
// Include counting sort visualization for each digit
```

### 2. User Experience Quick Wins:

**Immediate Improvements:**
- Add keyboard shortcuts (Space = play/pause, R = reset)
- Implement dark/light mode toggle
- Create floating speed control
- Add visualization export (screenshot/GIF)

### 3. Educational Value Boosters:

**Content Enhancements:**
- Add "Why use this algorithm?" sections
- Include real-world application examples  
- Create complexity comparison charts
- Add interactive quiz elements
